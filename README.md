# GooSig

GooSig was created specifically for the [Handshake Project][handshake] to
address a very specific problem: an [airdrop] to Github users' RSA keys allows
Github users to be _identified on-chain_. In order to anonymize who is
receiving coins from the airdrop, cryptographic trickery is required: GooSig
allows the creation of signatures originating from RSA private keys _without
revealing the RSA public key_.

GooSig implements a [cryptographic protocol][protocol] devised by Dan Boneh and
Riad Wahby at the Stanford Center for Blockchain Research which makes use of Groups of unknOwn Order. It was originally ported
from the python [reference implementation][libgoopy] to javascript, but has
since been [implemented in C][c] as well.

## Usage

``` js
const Goo = require('goosig');
const rsa = require('bcrypto/lib/rsa');

// Generate RSA private key.
const priv = rsa.privateKeyGenerate(2048);

// Publish RSA public key.
const pub = rsa.publicKeyCreate(priv);

// GooSig context (using the RSA-2048 challenge modulus).
const goo = new Goo(Goo.RSA2048, 2, 3);

// Generate s_prime and C1 based on user's pubkey.
// Handshake contributors do this part.
// `s_prime` is the seed for the `s` scalar.
const s_prime = goo.generate();
const C1 = goo.challenge(s_prime, pub);

// At this point, C1 is inserted into a public
// merkle tree and added to the HNS consensus rules.

// Encrypt s_prime to user's pubkey.
const ct = goo.encrypt(s_prime, pub);

// User decrypts the encrypted payload.
const pt = goo.decrypt(ct, priv);

pt.equals(s_prime) === true;

// Sign the hash of the serialized airdrop proof.
// This proof includes an address.
// Handshake users do this part after retrieving
// s_prime and C1 from the encrypted public files.
const msg = Buffer.alloc(32, 0xff); // A sighash in reality.
const sig = goo.sign(msg, s_prime, priv);

// Verify the proof.
// The Handshake blockchain does this part.
// C1 effectively becomes the "identifier" for the key.
const result = goo.verify(msg, sig, C1);

result === true;
```

## Moduli

The design of GooSig requires a public RSA modulus whose prime factorization is
unknown.

In the early 1990s, RSA Labs generated several [RSA moduli][numbers-wiki] for
the [RSA factoring challenge][challenge-wiki]. RSA Labs claims to have
[destroyed the hard drives][faq] containing the primes.

There are 4 built-in moduli exposed on the `Goo` object.

- [AOL1] - America Online Root CA 1 (now defunct) (2048 bit).
- [AOL2] - America Online Root CA 2 (now defunct) (4096 bit) - notable for
  being one of the few 4096 bit moduli in the wild.
- [RSA2048] - From the [RSA factoring challenge][challenge-wiki], and at one
  point had a $200,000 bounty on it (2048 bit).
- [RSA617] - Also from the factoring challenge (2048 bit). Generated later, in
  1997.

## Benchmarks

GooSig verifications are fairly complex and difficult to optimize. C
verification time is currently around 1ms with highend consumer-grade hardware.
We hope to get sub-1ms verification times by mainnet launch.
